\section{Introduzione}
Questo manuale descrive dettagliatamente la struttura tecnica e progettuale del sistema \textbf{BookRecommender}. Il documento è rivolto a sviluppatori e manutentori del sistema, fornendo una panoramica approfondita delle scelte architetturali, algoritmiche e strutturali adottate.

\section{Struttura dell'Applicazione}
L'applicazione è organizzata secondo un'architettura modulare in pacchetti. I principali componenti sono:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{controller} – gestione logica dell'applicazione
  \item \texttt{model} – rappresentazione dei dati (libri, utenti, raccomandazioni)
  \item \texttt{view} – interfaccia grafica (JavaFX/Swing)
  \item \texttt{utils} – classi di supporto
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[h]
  % \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{diagramma_classi.png}
  % \caption{Diagramma delle classi principali (UML)}
\end{figure}

\section{Scelte Progettuali}
\subsection{Diagrammi UML}
Il sistema è basato su un modello ad oggetti. Di seguito è riportato il diagramma delle classi e delle interazioni principali.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Class Diagram
  \item Sequence Diagram (per l’uso della raccomandazione)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Schema ER}
Nel caso di uso di una base di dati:
\begin{figure}[h]
  % \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{schema_er.png}
  % \caption{Schema ER: utenti, libri, raccomandazioni}
\end{figure}

\section{Scelte Architetturali}
L’applicazione è costruita secondo il pattern MVC:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Separazione tra logica, presentazione e gestione dati
  \item Facilità di estensione e testabilità
\end{itemize}
Altri aspetti architetturali:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Modularità (uso dei package)
  \item Dipendenze gestite tramite Maven
  \item JavaFX come UI framework
\end{itemize}

\section{Strutture Dati Utilizzate}
Sono state utilizzate strutture dati standard della Java Collection Framework:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{List<Book>} per collezioni di libri
  \item \texttt{Map<String, List<Book>>} per raccomandazioni per utente
  \item \texttt{Set<String>} per evitare duplicati
\end{itemize}

\section{Scelte Algoritmiche}
Il sistema di raccomandazione può includere (esempi):
\begin{itemize}
  \item Similarità basata su contenuto (coseno tra vettori di parole chiave)
  \item Filtraggio collaborativo semplice (similitudine tra utenti)
  \item Ordinamento per punteggio
\end{itemize}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java,caption={Algoritmo semplificato di raccomandazione}]
public List<Book> recommend(String userId) {
    List<Book> liked = getLikedBooks(userId);
    Map<Book, Double> scores = new HashMap<>();
    for (Book book : allBooks) {
        double score = computeSimilarity(book, liked);
        scores.put(book, score);
    }
    return scores.entrySet().stream()
        .sorted(Map.Entry.comparingByValue(Comparator.reverseOrder()))
        .limit(5)
        .map(Map.Entry::getKey)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Gestione dei File}
Il sistema carica/salva file di dati nei seguenti formati:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{CSV} per dati tabellari (libri, utenti)
  \item \texttt{JSON} opzionale per configurazioni
\end{itemize}
\begin{verbatim}
src/
 |-- main/
 |    |-- resources/
 |         |-- data/
 |              |-- books.csv
 |              |-- users.csv
\end{verbatim}

\section{Pattern Utilizzati}
\subsection{Singleton}
Utilizzato per gestire l'accesso centralizzato al sistema di raccomandazione.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java,caption={Pattern Singleton per RecommendationEngine}]
public class RecommendationEngine {
    private static RecommendationEngine instance;
    private RecommendationEngine() {}

    public static synchronized RecommendationEngine getInstance() {
        if (instance == null)
            instance = new RecommendationEngine();
        return instance;
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{MVC}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Model: classi \texttt{Book}, \texttt{User}
  \item View: classi GUI JavaFX
  \item Controller: logica di interazione
\end{itemize}

\section{Documentazione JavaDoc}
Tutte le classi sono documentate con JavaDoc. Esempio:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java,caption={JavaDoc per classe Book}]
/**
 * Classe che rappresenta un libro.
 * Contiene titolo, autore, genere e valutazione.
 */
public class Book {
    private String title;
    private String author;
    private String genre;
    private double rating;
    // costruttori, metodi getter/setter, ecc.
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Schema del Database}
Lo schema SQL seguente definisce tutte le tabelle utilizzate dal sistema, inclusi libri, utenti, valutazioni e librerie.

195153448	Classical Mythology	Mark P. O. Morford	Mythology	Building on the bestselling tradition of previous editions, Classical Mythology, Tenth Edition, is the most comprehensive survey of classical mythology available--and the first full-color textbook of its kind. Featuring the authors' clear and extensive translations of original sources, it brings to life the myths and legends of Greece and Rome in a lucid and engaging style. The text contains a wide variety of faithfully translated passages from Greek and Latin sources, including Homer, Hesiod, all the Homeric Hymns, Pindar, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Herodotus, Plato, Lucian, Lucretius, Vergil, Ovid, and Seneca.\nAcclaimed authors Mark P.O. Morford, Robert J. Lenardon, and Michael Sham incorporate a dynamic combination of poetic narratives and enlightening commentary to make the myths come alive for students. Offering historical and cultural background on the myths (including evidence from art and archaeology) they also provide ample interpretative material and examine the enduring survival of classical mythology and its influence in the fields of art, literature, music, dance, and film.	2002	Oxford University Press	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0195153448.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg
2005018	Clara Callan	Richard Bruce Wright	Fiction	In a small town in Canada, Clara Callan reluctantly takes leave of her sister, Nora, who is bound for New York. It's a time when the growing threat of fascism in Europe is a constant worry, and people escape from reality through radio and the movies. Meanwhile, the two sisters - vastly different in personality, yet inextricably linked by a shared past - try to find their places within the complex web of social expectations for young women in the 1930s.\nWhile Nora embarks on a glamorous career as a radio-soap opera star, Clara, a strong and independent-minded woman, struggles to observe the traditional boundaries of a small and tight-knit community without relinquishing her dreams of love, freedom, and adventure. However, things aren't as simple as they appear - Nora's letters eventually reveal life in the big city is less exotic than it seems, and the tranquil solitude of Clara's life is shattered by a series of unforeseeable events. These twists of fate require all of Clara's courage and strength, and finally put the seemingly unbreakable bond between the sisters to the test.	2001	HarperFlamingo Canada	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0002005018.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg
60973129	Decision in Normandy	Carlo D'Este	History	The battle for Normandy was the most complex and daring military operation in the history of modern warfare. Two years of intense, detailed planning reached its successful conclusion when the Allied forces took the beaches on D-Day. But the seventy-six-day campaign that followed, the Allies' crucial bid for a toehold in western Europe, was one of the bloodiest of the war, and its true story has been concealed in myth. Drawing on a wealth of previously unpublished papers, declassified documents, diaries, and personal interviews, Carlo D'Este has written the first full account of what actually happened in Normandy, how the campaign went wrong, and how it was eventually won. Step-by-step the reader is taken through the Normandy campaign from the earliest days after Dunkirk when Churchill first considered the idea of a cross-channel invasion of France, to the key battles that determined that outcome, with maps clearly explaining the strategy and logistics of each battle.	1991	HarperPerennial	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0060973129.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg
374157065	Flu: The Story of the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 and the Search for the Virus That Caused It	Gina Bari Kolata	Social Science	Richly illustrated and vividly written, Pacific Northwest by Hans Johannes Hoefer offers an engaging journey through one of North America’s most diverse and scenic regions. Blending cultural insight with striking photography, the book explores the area’s lush landscapes, Indigenous heritage, and vibrant urban centers. With a focus on both natural beauty and human stories, Hoefer presents the Pacific Northwest as a place where tradition and modern life coexist in dynamic harmony.	1999	Farrar Straus Giroux	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0374157065.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg
393045218	The Mummies of Urumchi	E. J. W. Barber	Design	In the museums of Urumchi, the wind-swept regional capital of the Uyghur Autonomous Region in Western China, a collection of ancient mummies date back as far as 4,000 years - contemporary to the famous Egyptian mummies, but even more beautifully preserved, especially their clothing. Surprisingly, these prehistoric people are not Asian but Caucasoid - tall and large-nosed and blond with thick beards and round eyes (probably blue). What were these blond Caucasians doing in the heart of Asia? Where did they come from and what language did they speak? Might they be related to a "lost tribe" of Indo-Europeans known from later inscriptions? Few gifts are to be found in the graves of Urumchi, making it difficult for archaeologists to pinpoint cultural connections from clues offered by pottery and tools. But their clothes - woolens that rarely survive more than a few centurieshave been preserved as brightly hued as the day they were woven." "Elizabeth Wayland Barber describes these remarkable mummies, their clothing, their sheepherding ways, and their path to this remote, mysterious, and forbidding place. She pieces together their history and peculiar Western connections from both what she saw in Urumchi and the testimony of explorers who traveled along the Silk Road a century earlier."--Jacket	1999	W. W. Norton &amp; Company	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0393045218.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg
399135782	The Kitchen God's Wife	Amy Tan	Fiction	Winnie and Helen have kept each other's worst secrets for more than fifty years. Now, because she believes she is dying, Helen wants to expose everything. And Winnie angrily determines that she must be the one to tell her daughter, Pearl, about the past—including the terrible truth even Helen does not know. And so begins Winnie's story of her life on a small island outside Shanghai in the 1920s, and other places in China during World War II, and traces the happy and desperate events that led to Winnie's coming to America in 1949. The Kitchen God's Wife is "a beautiful book" (Los Angeles Times) from the bestselling author of novels like The Joy Luck Club and The Backyard Bird Chronicles, and the memoir, Where the Past Begins.	1991	Putnam Pub Group	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0399135782.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg
60930365	My First Cousin Once Removed: Money, Madness, and the Family of Robert Lowell	Sarah Payne Stuart	Biography & Autobiography	The art of being truly funny is an undervalued one in these angst-ridden times, but it is an ability that acclaimed novelist Sarah Payne Stuart has in abundance. Her talents have never been on more glorious display than in My First Cousin Once Removed, a memoir--at once hilarious, personal and sad--of her extraordinary Boston Brahmin family, whose most famous member is the legendary poet Robert Lowell, the author's first cousin (once removed).	1999	Perennial	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0060930365.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

375759778	Prague : A Novel	ARTHUR PHILLIPS	Fiction	A first novel of startling scope and ambition, Prague depicts an intentionally lost Lost Generation as it follows five American expats who come to Budapest in the early 1990s to seek their fortune—financial, romantic, and spiritual—in an exotic city newly opened to the West. They harbor the vague suspicion that their counterparts in Prague, where the atmospheric decay of post–Cold War Europe is even more cinematically perfect, have it better. Still, they hope to find adventure, inspiration, a gold rush, or history in the making. What they actually find is a deceptively beautiful place that they often fail to understand. What does it mean to fret about your fledgling career when the man across the table was tortured by two different regimes? How does your short, uneventful life compare to the lives of those who actually resisted, fought, and died? What does your angst mean in a city still pocked with bullet holes from war and crushed rebellion?\nJournalist John Price finds these questions impossible to answer yet impossible to avoid, though he tries to forget them in the din of Budapest’s nightclubs, in a romance with a secretive young diplomat, at the table of an elderly cocktail pianist, and in the moody company of a young man obsessed with nostalgia. Arriving in Budapest one spring day to pursue his elusive brother, John finds himself pursuing something else entirely, something he can’t quite put a name to, something that will draw him into stories much larger than himself.\nWith humor, intelligence, masterly prose, and profound affection for both Budapest and his own characters, Arthur Phillips not only captures his contemporaries but also brilliantly renders the Hungary of past and present: the generations of failed revolutionaries and lyric poets, opportunists and profiteers, heroes and storytellers.	2003	Random House Trade Paperbacks	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0375759778.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

375500766	Care Packages : Letters to Christopher Reeve from Strangers and Other Friends	DANA REEVE	Biography & Autobiography	When Christopher Reeve was paralyzed in a riding accident on May 27, 1995, letters poured in from around the world, some addressed only to "Superman, USA." It was an astonishing demonstration of sympathy and support for a man who had become an American icon. In Care Packages, Dana Reeve, Christopher's wife, has collected some of the most unforgettable letters and gifts that her family received. There are thoughts and prayers from Hollywood's greatest stars, like Katharine Hepburn ("Golly. What a mess. Call me.") and Robert De Niro, politicians and presidents, and, of course, the everyday heroes who have prevailed in the face of nearly overwhelming adversity to lead rich and fulfilling lives. These letters are inspiring, funny, surprising, and always deeply touching. Some writers offer advice (listen to jazz, try LSD psychotherapy, get a cat), while others simply tell their own stories in a beautiful gesture of hope and community. And sometimes the youngest fans say it best ("I'm sorry that you fell off your horse. Let's hope it won't happen again"; "i broke my neck....im ok now. i hope you will be too"). But Care Packages is not only about the "strangers and other friends" who have had such a profound effect on the Reeves. With an introduction to each chapter by Dana Reeve, it is also the story of a marriage and a family facing the ultimate test--from the fear of the emergency room to the long, hard days of rehab to the bittersweet moments of a wedding anniversary--and reaffirming their commitment in a thousand new ways.	1999	Random House	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0375500766.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

451410319	Hush	Anne Frasier	Young Adult Fiction	Hush What's your greatest fear? It's criminal profiler Ivy Dunlap's job to unravel the psyches of the most dangerous men alive. None haunts her dreams more than the killer who took her son's life sixteen years ago, then silently disappeared into the dark. Now an urgent request for help from the Chicago police has reawakened Ivy's greatest nightmare. The Madonna Murderer has returned to fulfill his calling. This time Ivy understands the killer and will face her greatest fear to stop him from killing again. Publishers Weekly Few serial killers penned by suspense writers today are as warped or as fully realized as the Madonna Murderer, who preys on newborn baby boys and their unwed mothers. As if the crime itself isn't bad enough, the killer leaves a musical snow globe that plays "Hush, Little Baby" in the infant's crib as his calling card. It has been nearly two decades since Ivy Dunlap and her infant son were victimized by the Madonna Murderer. Unbeknownst to the killer, Ivy survived the assault. Her baby didn't. Now a respected criminal psychologist, Ivy is called into service by the Chicago P.D. when the killer resurfaces after 16 years of dormancy. Her personal interest in the case takes on a sharper edge when she learns that her partner, Detective Max Irving, has a son named Ethan who is the same age her child would have been had he survived. When Ivy tries to rattle the Madonna Murderer by publishing a "dead-baby letter" in the newspaper, the killer becomes more daring; he befriends Ethan, sends Ivy a chunk of his skin bearing a tattoo and expands his profile of victims. Although some readers may be turned off by the novel's graphic nature, a wealth of procedural detail, a heart-thumping finale and two scarred but indelible protagonists make this a first-rate debut.	2002	Onyx Books	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0451410319.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

451525221	Scarlet Letter	Nathaniel Hawthorne	Adultery	The Scarlet Letter: A Romance is a work of historical fiction by American author Nathaniel Hawthorne, published in 1850. Set in Puritan Massachusetts Bay Colony during the years 1642 to 1649, the novel tells the story of Hester Prynne, who conceives a daughter through an affair and then struggles to create a new life of repentance and dignity. Containing a number of religious and historic allusions, the book explores themes of legalism, sin, and guilt.\nIts great burden is the weight of unacknowledged sin as seen in the remorse and cowardice and suffering of the Rev. Arthur Dimmesdale. Contrasted with his concealed agony is the constant confession, conveyed by the letter, which is forced upon Hester, and has a double effect, — a healthful one, working beneficently, and making her helpful and benevolent, tolerant and thoughtful ; and an unhealthful one, which by the great emphasis placed on her transgression, the keeping her forever under its ban and isolating her from her fellows, prepares her to break away from the long repression and lapse again into sin when she plans her flight. Roger Chillingworth is an embodiment of subtle and refined revenge.\nThe book though corresponding in its tone and burden to some of the shorter stories, had a more startling and dramatic character, and a strangeness, which at once took hold of a larger public than any of those had attracted. Though imperfectly comprehended, and even misunderstood in some quarters, it was seen to have a new and unique quality; and Hawthorne's reputation became national.	1993	Signet Book	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0451525221.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

60801263	Tree Grows In Brooklyn	Betty Smith	Fiction	From the moment she entered the world, Francie needed to be made of stern stuff, for the often harsh life of Williamsburg demanded fortitude, precocity, and strength of spirit. Often scorned by neighbors for her family’s erratic and eccentric behavior-such as her father Johnny’s taste for alcohol and Aunt Sissy’s habit of marrying serially without the formality of divorce-no one, least of all Francie, could say that the Nolans’ life lacked drama. By turns overwhelming, sublime, heartbreaking, and uplifting, the Nolans’ daily experiences are tenderly threaded with family connectedness and raw with honesty. Betty Smith has, in the pages of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, captured the joys of humble Williamsburg life-from “junk day” on Saturdays, when the children of Francie’s neighborhood traded their weekly take for pennies, to the special excitement of holidays, bringing cause for celebration and revelry. Smith has created a work of literary art that brilliantly captures a unique time and place as well as deeply resonant moments of universal experience. Here is an American classic that "cuts right to the heart of life," hails the New York Times.

385337639	Crow Lake (Today Show Book Club #7)	Mary Lawson	Fiction	Crow Lake is that rare find, a first novel so quietly assured, so emotionally pitch perfect, you know from the opening page that this is the real thing—a literary experience in which to lose yourself, by an author of immense talent.\nHere is a gorgeous, slow-burning story set in the rural “badlands” of northern Ontario, where heartbreak and hardship are mirrored in the landscape. For the farming Pye family, life is a Greek tragedy where the sins of the fathers are visited on the sons, and terrible events occur—offstage.\nCenterstage are the Morrisons, whose tragedy looks more immediate if less brutal, but is, in reality, insidious and divisive. Orphaned young, Kate Morrison was her older brother Matt’s protegee, her fascination for pond life fed by his passionate interest in the natural world. Now a zoologist, she can identify organisms under a microscope but seems blind to the state of her own emotional life. And she thinks she’s outgrown her siblings—Luke, Matt, and Bo—who were once her entire world.\nIn this universal drama of family love and misunderstandings, of resentments harbored and driven underground, Lawson ratchets up the tension with heartbreaking humor and consummate control, continually overturning one’s expectations right to the very end. Tragic, funny, unforgettable, Crow Lake is a quiet tour de force that will catapult Mary Lawson to the forefront of fiction writers today.	2003	Delta	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0385337639.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

345391691	The Battle for God	Karen Armstrong	Religion	In the late twentieth century, fundamentalism has emerged as one of the most powerful forces at work in the world, contesting the dominance of modern secular values and threatening peace and harmony around the globe. Yet it remains incomprehensible to a large number of people. In The Battle for God, Karen Armstrong brilliantly and sympathetically shows us how and why fundamentalist groups came into existence and what they yearn to accomplish.\nWe see the West in the sixteenth century beginning to create an entirely new kind of civilization, which brought in its wake change in every aspect of life -- often painful and violent, even if liberating. Armstrong argues that one of the things that changed most was religion. People could no longer think about or experience the divine in the same way; they had to develop new forms of faith to fit their new circumstances.\nArmstrong characterizes fundamentalism as one of these new ways of being religious that have emerged in every major faith tradition. Focusing on Protestant fundamentalism in the United States, Jewish fundamentalism in Israel, and Muslim fundamentalism in Egypt and Iran, she examines the ways in which these movements, while not monolithic, have each sprung from a dread of modernity -- often in response to assault (sometimes unwitting, sometimes intentional) by the mainstream society.\nArmstrong sees fundamentalist groups as complex, innovative, and modern -- rather than as throwbacks to the past -- but contends that they have failed in religious terms. Maintaining that fundamentalism often exists in symbiotic relationship with an aggressive modernity, each impelling the other on to greater excess, she suggests compassion as a way to defuse what is now an intensifying conflict.	2001	Ballantine Books	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0345391691.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

345435869	The Rivan Codex : Ancient Texts of THE BELGARIAD and THE MALLOREON	DAVID EDDINGS	Fiction	Comprising the ancient texts of The Belgariad and The Malloreon, The Rivan Codex is a book which stands in the same relationship to the Belgariad and Malloreon as The Silmarillion does to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. Before David Eddings started to write his first fantasy series, the BELGARIAD, in the late 1970s, he spent a year working on the design and mythology of the fantasy world in which it is set. The Rivan Codex comprises the immensely readable background material to Eddings’ best-loved series, repeated information a lot of it, but it’s the books that repeat the information, and these seminal documents have about them an air of original inspiration, world-building in action. The rest of it is background which is taken for granted but not spelled out. History, geography, myths and folktales, peoples, gods, customs, social organization, political hierarchy, laws, dress, modes of address, produce, culture, flora, fauna, all presented with so light a touch one can only yearn for Eddings to be taken up by academics so that his style might catch on in the real real world. The 12-book long series grew out of these delightful preliminary sketches like a river growing from a spring of striking purity and constancy. Magically, the information reads fresh each time, minimal Eddings prose, beguilingly arcane, in which massive events attain an all-time perspective.	1999	Del Rey	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0345435869.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

684180200	NEW SHOE	Arthur William Upfield	Juvenile Nonfiction	This book was originally published in 1951 and Upfield pretty much crammed it all in here for a particularly savory cozy murder read. Detective Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte, ("Bony" to his many friends and Upfield's regular man who is half-Caucasian and half-Aborigine), is called in to snoop around undercover and discover who stowed a naked corpse within the confines of an old lighthouse closet. The tale is set post World War II at a southeastern Australian coastal community, Split Point. Playing out within a well-established Upfield formula, Bony enters in to this hornet's nest armed with two promises extracted from his no interference in his investigative activities, and they are not to press him regarding his progress on the case. The local police have initially failed to solve the murder and (as usual) Bony is called in weeks later after all reasonable hope of resolution has been abandoned. Of course Bony's superiors prevail upon him in such instances because he has never failed to "finalize" a case. Posing as a sheep rancher on vacation, Bony initially checks in at the small local hotel and pub. He finds some folks friendly but many are stand-offish, and they appear to have more reason for this than mere clannishness. As Australia's premier detective unearths more and more clues the heat turns up until Bony finally finds himself in imminent personal danger... and that happens not long after Bony encounters a second dead body! This specific edition offers multiple enhanced features. First there is a very nice mini-biography of Upfield in an introduction written by John Ball. Included in the back of the book is a comprehensive bibliography of all Upfield books along with a brief commentary on each one. Finally, the publishers have included an enlightening map of Australia which indicates the location of each of the Upfield mysteries.	1983	Scribner Paper Fiction	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0684180200.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

553210092	The Scarlet Letter	NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE	Fiction	We dream in our waking moments, and walk in our sleep.” ? Nathaniel Hawthorne, The Scarlet Letter\nThe Scarlet Letter: A Romance is a work of historical fiction by American author Nathaniel Hawthorne, published in 1850. Set in Puritan Massachusetts Bay Colony during the years 1642 to 1649, the novel tells the story of Hester Prynne, who conceives a daughter through an affair and then struggles to create a new life of repentance and dignity. Containing a number of religious and historic allusions, the book explores themes of legalism, sin, and guilt.\nIts great burden is the weight of unacknowledged sin as seen in the remorse and cowardice and suffering of the Rev. Arthur Dimmesdale. Contrasted with his concealed agony is the constant confession, conveyed by the letter, which is forced upon Hester, and has a double effect, — a healthful one, working beneficently, and making her helpful and benevolent, tolerant and thoughtful ; and an unhealthful one, which by the great emphasis placed on her transgression, the keeping her forever under its ban and isolating her from her fellows, prepares her to break away from the long repression and lapse again into sin when she plans her flight. Roger Chillingworth is an embodiment of subtle and refined revenge.\nThe book though corresponding in its tone and burden to some of the shorter stories, had a more startling and dramatic character, and a strangeness, which at once took hold of a larger public than any of those had attracted. Though imperfectly comprehended, and even misunderstood in some quarters, it was seen to have a new and unique quality; and Hawthorne's reputation became national.	1965	Bantam	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0553210092.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

385503857	Oryx and Crake	Margaret Atwood	Fiction	Snowman lives in a tree near the sea, wrapped in a dirty sheet. He doesn't know what time it is, no one does anymore, after the pandemic. He searches for food and medicine in the desolate lands infested with animal hybrids. He rummages through the remains and mulls over the choices that led to the collapse of the Earth, in the name of an omnipotent science. He abandons himself to the memory of Oryx, an enigmatic and quiet woman, and to the resentment for his friend Crake, responsible for the disaster. Their lives had intertwined in the most classic and tragic of triangles. Snowman seeks an explanation, for himself and for the "children of Crake", the only form of intelligent life that has survived on Earth, an exemplary fruit of genetic engineering. There are many things they want to understand, unaware as they are of the senselessness of men.

What do you feel when, after eleven years, you find your lover again and discover that he is walking the path of sainthood and is able to perform miracles? What are the thoughts (and hopes) that echo in the mind and that make the body jolt with sobs or laughter? For Pilar, the dream of an existence alongside her beloved seems to dissolve in the icy waters of the Piedra River, but sometimes even the whirlpools, waterfalls and pebbles of a stream - along with the sound of footsteps behind - can reinvent destiny and make one understand that "to love means to communicate with the other and discover in him a particle of God".	0	Fabbri - RCS Libri	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/8845229041.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

His deep concern for the role of the artist in society appears in "An Open Letter to All and Sundry," and in "The Angel is My Watermark" he writes of his own passionate love affair with painting. "The Immorality of Morality" is an eloquent discussion of censorship. Some of the stories, such as "First Love," are autobiographical, and there are portraits of friends, such as "Patchen: Man of Anger and Light," and essays on other writers such as Walt Whitman, Thoreau, Sherwood Anderson and Ionesco.\nTaken together, these highly readable pieces reflect the incredible vitality and variety of interests of the writer who extended the frontiers of modern literature with Tropic of Cancer and other great books. 	1962	New Directions Publishing Corporation	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0811203220.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg
1573229148	Crossing the Unknown Sea: Work As a Pilgrimage of Identity	David Whyte	Business & Economics	Crossing the Unknown Sea is about reuniting the imagination with our day to day lives. It shows how poetry and practicality, far from being mutually exclusive, reinforce each other to give every aspect of our lives meaning and direction. For anyone who wants to deepen their connection to their life’s work—or find out what their life’s work is—this book can help navigate the way.\nWhyte encourages readers to take risks at work that will enhance their personal growth, and shows how burnout can actually be beneficial and used to renew professional interest. He asserts that too many people blindly trudge through a mediocre work life because so many “busy” tasks prevent significant reflection and analysis of job satisfaction. People often turn to spiritual practice or religion to nurture their souls, but overlook how work can actually be our greatest opportunity for discovery and growth. Crossing the Unknown Sea combines poetry, gifted storytelling and Whyte’s personal experience to reveal work’s potential to fulfill us and bring us closer to ultimate freedom and happiness.	2002	Riverhead Books	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1573229148.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

They were a couple obsessed with success. After years of matching IQs and test scores with less driven peers, they had two Harvard degrees apiece and were gunning for more. They’d plotted out a future in the most vaunted ivory tower of academe. \nBut when their unborn son, Adam, was diagnosed with Down syndrome, doctors, advisers, and friends in the Harvard community warned them that if they decided to keep the baby, they would lose all hope of achieving their carefully crafted goals.  \nFortunately, that’s exactly what happened. By the time Adam was born, Martha and John were propelled into a world in which they were forced to redefine everything of value to them, put all their faith in miracles, and trust that they could fly without a net. And it worked.\nExpecting Adam captures the abject terror and exhilarating freedom of facing impending parenthood, being forced to question one’s deepest beliefs, and rewriting life’s rules.	2000	Berkley Publishing Group	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0425174484.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

684717255	I And Thou	Martin Buber	Religion	2010 Reprint of 1937 American Edition. "I and Thou", perhaps Buber's most famous work, was first published in 1923, and translated to English in 1937. Buber's main proposition is that we may address existence in two ways: [1] that of the "I" towards an "It", towards an object that is separate in itself, which we either use or experience; [2] that of the 'I' towards 'Thou', in which we move into existence in a relationship without bounds. One of the major themes of the book is that human life finds its meaningfulness in relationships. All of our relationships, Buber contends, bring us ultimately into relationship with God, who is the Eternal Thou.	1971	Free Press	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0684717255.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

316735027	The True and Outstanding Adventures of the Hunt Sisters: A Novel	Elisabeth Robinson	Fiction	The best letters are the ones that tell you everything. Not just the big, important stuff, but the little details of life. The True and Outstanding Adventures of the Hunt Sisters is a one-sided epistolary novel. We get to read all the letters written by Olivia Hunt, erstwhile film producer, over the year she learns her sister Maddie has cancer. Olivia scuttles between her hometown in Ohio, where Maddie still lives, and Los Angeles, where she's trying to get a film version of Don Quixote off the ground. Along the way, she writes newsy letters to her best friend Tina, crabby mash notes to her ex-boyfriend Michael, worried missives to her parents, breezy memos to (real-life) entertainment honchos, and cheery entertainments to Maddie herself. These epistles are crammed full of the asides and rambling descriptions that make for good letters, and good books. She writes, for instance, "I went down to the cafeteria. Judy, the cashier, told me her daughter passed the Bar exam, so that was nice to hear. She said I looked tired. I ate some iceberg lettuce with orange dressing in the empty cafeteria. And two chocolate chip cookies." It's not poetry, but the orange dressing and the chatty cashier go a long way toward capturing hospital life. It also helps that first-time author Elisabeth Robinson is a producer and screenwriter who worked on Braveheart (among others); she's just as detailed and knowing when she describes the seemingly Herculean task of producing a film. She includes gentle send-ups of Robin Williams and John Cleese, who star in the fictional picture, and terrifying glimpses of executive tantrums. (A Hollywood background has its the book occasionally strays into formula.) In the end, Robinson's hard work with all those details ultimately results in a believable, lovable heroine. --Claire Dederer	2004	Little, Brown	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0316735027.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

But that night, in a sign of things to come, a simple pickup game turned into an amazing display of basketball brilliance--freshmen against established players, and with barely a shot missed by either side.  Suddenly Pat Summitt glimpsed the future: fast, aggressive and hugely talented.  This might be the team she'd worked her whole career to coach.\nAs the season got under way, other dramas unfolded.  After one emotional team meeting, Summitt realized that many on the team were playing for something more than just the glory of the game: all four freshmen, for example, came from single-parent homes, and the tough circumstances of the majority of the other players seemed to add an extra edge to their desire to win it all.  Further, Chamique Holdsclaw, widely regarded as the greatest female player ever, was being dogged by questions about turning pro--and she seemed reluctant to rule it out.  Meanwhile, another member of the team began to notice the unwelcome attentions of a fan, who soon turned out to be a full-fledged stalker.	1998	Broadway Books	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0767903285.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

You gotta love the Belz. . . . His sharp sense of humor doesn’t allow him to miss an opportunity for laughs.”—Playboy\nI’m not asking you to believe every single conspiracy theory you find in this book. . . . I didn’t write this book to give you all the answers. I wrote this book to inspire you to do what the powers that be wish you wouldn’t: question authority . . . and to keep an eye out for Elvis\nJust what is it that they don’t want you to know about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Area 51, and what the American astronauts really found on the moon? The unexplained crash at Roswell and the mysterious “face” on Mars? The link between the Nazis and the U.S. space program? Evidence of extraterrestrial experimentation?\nFinally, one lone “nut” exposes the conspiracy to keep conspiracies a dirty little secret, standing up to the shadowy forces that would have us believe that Oswald acted alone, those lights in the sky are weather balloons, and fluoridated water is good for you (yeah, right). “Some of the smartest people I know . . . find it easier—and certainly more comforting—to believe that America is the only country on earth with no conspiracies at all.” Just remember: do not ask on whom The Belz has told—he’s told on them.	1999	Ballantine Books	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0345429176.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

895872102	The Hauntings of Williamsburg, Yorktown, and Jamestown	Jackie Eileen Behrend	Electronic books	Williamsburg, Yorktown, and Jamestown comprise Virginia's historic triangle. Some of the most important chapters of America's history unfolded in these settlements. The region has been the scene of violent confrontations between settlers and the original natives, an emotional struggle for independence, a bitter civil war, and, most recently, a transformation into one of the country's finest examples of historic restoration. Some parapsychologists believe that spirits can be awakened by a sudden flurry of activity. With so much activity occurring throughout the area's history, it is little wonder that there are so many documented sightings of ghosts in this triangle. In this book, Jackie Behrend brings together thirty-seven of the region's most intriguing spirits. From Williamsburg come tales about the Wagon of Death, which can still be heard rolling down Nicholson Street as it brings prisoners to the gallows; the colonial celebrations that continue at the Raleigh Tavern; the residential area where all is quiet except for the ghosts still fighting the Revolutionary War; and the ongoing wedding that brings men form both sides of the Civil War together. From Yorktown come stories about the sounds that emanate from the cave where Lord Cornwallis hid during the town's siege during 1781; the mournful tune that is heard on Surrender Field; and the melancholy feeling that overcomes people retracing the path where slaves were once marched. From Jamestown comes the tale of a deserted lover's angry ghost who still haunts the banks of the James River. From Carter's Grove comes the story of a slave who still searches Old Country Road for his lost family.

521427150	Belonging in the Two Berlins : Kin, State, Nation (Cambridge Studies in Social and Cultural Anthropology)	John Borneman	Berlin (Germany)	Belonging in the two Berlins is an ethnographic investigation into the meaning of German selfhood during the Cold War. Taking the practices of everyday life in the divided Berlin as his point of departure, Borneman shows how ideas of kin, state, and nation were constructed through processes of mirror-imaging and misrecognition. Using linguistics and narrative analysis, he compares the autobiographies of two generations of Berlins residents with the official version of the lifecourse prescribed by the two German states. He examines the relation of the dual political structure to everyday life, the way in which the two states legally regulated the lifecourse in order to define the particular categories of self which signify Germanness, and how citizens experientially appropriated the frameworks provided by these states. Living in the two Berlins constantly compelled residents to define themselves in opposition to their other half. Borneman argues that this resulted in a de facto divided Germany with two distinct nations and peoples. The formation of German subjectivity since World War II is unique in that the distinctive features for belonging - for being at home - to one side exclude the other. Indeed, these divisions inscribed by the Cold War account for many of the problems in forging a new cultural unity.	1992	Cambridge University Press	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0521427150.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

MCELVAINE	History	One of the classic studies of the Great Depression, featuring a new introduction by the author with insights into the economic crises of 1929 and today.\nIn the twenty-five years since its publication, critics and scholars have praised historian Robert McElvaine’s sweeping and authoritative history of the Great Depression as one of the best and most readable studies of the era. Combining clear-eyed insight into the machinations of politicians and economists who struggled to revive the battered economy, personal stories from the average people who were hardest hit by an economic crisis beyond their control, and an evocative depiction of the popular culture of the decade, McElvaine paints an epic picture of an America brought to its knees—but also brought together by people’s widely shared plight. \nIn a new introduction, McElvaine draws striking parallels between the roots of the Great Depression and the economic meltdown that followed in the wake of the credit crisis of 2008. He also examines the resurgence of anti-regulation free market ideology, beginning in the Reagan era, and argues that some economists and politicians revised history and ignored the lessons of the Depression era.	1993	Three Rivers Press	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0812923278.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

Tobin	Social Science	The fascinating story of a friendship, a lost tradition, and an incredible discovery, revealing how enslaved men and women made encoded quilts and then used them to navigate their escape on the Underground Railroad.  \nIn Hidden in Plain View, historian Jacqueline Tobin and scholar Raymond Dobard offer the first proof that certain quilt patterns, including a prominent one called the Charleston Code, were, in fact, essential tools for escape along the Underground Railroad.

688048730	Thinking on paper	V. A Howard	Language Arts & Disciplines	Thinking on Paper shows how writer's block as well as many other writing problems are engendered by the tendency, supported by traditional approaches, to separate thinking from writing. Drawing on the developing field of symbol theory, V.A. Howard and J.H. Barton explain why this separation is unsound and demonstrate how to improve dramatically our ability to generate and express ideas. \nMost books on writing assume that the sole purpose of writing is communication. These manuals seldom go beyond teaching how to avoid the problems of punctuation, grammar, and style that at one time or another ensnare the best of writers. Few, if any, of these books explore writing as a way of shaping thought.\nHoward and Barton, two Harvard researchers in education, take a radically different approach. While they agree with their predecessors that an important function of writing is the clear, direct expression of thought, they point out that many of our thoughts first come into being only when put to paper. By failing to recognize the link between thinking and writing, we fall into the deadlock inappropriately named writer's block.\nFor everyone who writes, this is a readable, accessible manual of immense educational and practical value.	1986	W.

380002450	Awakening	Kate Chopin	Juvenile Nonfiction	e Awakening, originally titled A Solitary Soul, is a novel by Kate Chopin, first published in 1899. Set in New Orleans and on the Louisiana Gulf coast at the end of the 19th century, the plot centers on Edna Pontellier and her struggle to reconcile her increasingly unorthodox views on femininity and motherhood with the prevailing social attitudes of the turn-of-the-century American South. It is one of the earliest American novels that focuses on women's issues without condescension. It is also widely seen as a landmark work of early feminism, generating a mixed reaction from contemporary readers and critics.The novel's blend of realistic narrative, incisive social commentary, and psychological complexity makes The Awakening a precursor of American modernist literature; it prefigures the works of American novelists such as William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway and echoes the works of contemporaries such as Edith Wharton and Henry James. It can also be considered among the first Southern works in a tradition that would culminate with the modern masterpieces of Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, Eudora Welty, Katherine Anne Porter, and Tennessee Williams.	1982	Avon	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0380002450.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

312422156	Middlesex: A Novel	Jeffrey Eugenides	Fiction	Middlesex is a significantly more ambitious and much odder novel than Jeffrey Eugenides' resonant debut, The Virgin Suicides (on DVD), which was a bittersweet paean to adolescent love. This is a sprawling family saga, bursting with life, which spans three generations and crosses several continents. At its core, however, is another unorthodox but exquisite coming-of-age story.\nThe book's wily narrator and central character, Calliope Stephanides (named after the muse of epic poetry) is a hermaphrodite raised as a girl who comes to realise she is happier as a boy and is now living as a man in contemporary Berlin. Cal's tale begins, appropriately enough, in Greece (or more precisely Asia Minor)--an Aegean Strasbourg whose sovereignty is claimed by Greece and Turkey. In 1922 brother and sister Lefty and Desdemona Stephanides escaped their war-torn homeland and arrived, as man and wife, in Detroit, America. It is this coupling that ultimately begets their grandchild Calliope and her ambiguous sexuality, as she, or rather by then he, sanguinely notes:\nSome people inherit houses; others painting or highly insured violin bows. Still others get Japanese tansu or a famous name. I got a recessive gene on fifth chromosome and some very rare family jewels indeed.\nAs Cal recounts the experiences of the Stephanides clan in their new land--from the Depression to Nixon--he unfurls his own symbiotic odyssey to a new sex. Cal's narrative voice is arch, humorous and self aware, continually drawing attention to its authorial sleights of hand, but never exasperating. This is big, brainy novel--The Oracle of Delphi puts in an unlikely appearance in the middle of a teenage tryst--but one full of compassion. Eugenides' astonishingly rich story persistently engages the heart as well as the mind. --Travis Elborough	2003	Picador	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0312422156.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

140070206	Ironweed	William J. Kennedy	Fiction	Francis Phelan, ex grande promessa del football, è un uomo che ha toccato il fondo e ha guardato in faccia l'abisso quando, nello stupore dell'alcol, si è lasciato cadere dalle braccia il figlio neonato e lo ha visto morire senza far nulla. Fuggito da Albany, vi fa ritorno nel 1938 da vagabondo: scava fosse nel cimitero locale in cambio di pochi dollari, che spenderà stordendosi di liquore insieme a Helen, la barbona che lo accompagna nelle sue peregrinazioni, e vaga per le strade della sua giovinezza, cercando di venire a patti con i fantasmi del suo passato e del presente. Romanzo di straziante intensità, che si muove sul confine sottile tra la disperazione e la speranza, l'abominio e il riscatto, Ironweed ha una storia che rasenta l'incredibile: respinto da tutti gli editori cui era stato dato in lettura, venne pubblicato da Viking grazie all'intercessione personale di Saul Bellow. Dal romanzo è stato poi tratto un film, per la regia di Héctor Babenco, con Jack Nicholson e Meryl Streep nelle parti di Francis e Helen.	1989	Penguin Books	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0140070206.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

DeFoe is in love with Imogen, the young caretaker of the sole small Jewish cemetery in Halifax Nova Scotia, where the novel begins in 1938. She becomes obssessed with a Dutch painting called Jewess on a Street in Amsterdam and abandons her life to look for nobility in the intensity of life in Amsterdam for Jews in the late 30s. The book is an examination of the desire to step out of the everyday and into action, with a startling conclusion. With echoes of the holocaust and of a world lost but not forgotten, this is a poignant and perfect novel of great power.	1998	Farrar Straus Giroux	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0374216495.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

316825336	Evening News: A Novel	Marly A. Swick	Fiction	Nine year-old Teddy is playing next door with his best friend when Eric pulls out his father's handgun and hands it to Teddy. The telephone rings; the gun goes off, shooting -- and killing -- Teddy's two-year-old half sister Trina, who was playing in a wading pool in the yard outside, with Giselle, their mother, by her side.\nThus begins Marly Swick's second novel after the highly acclaimed "Paper Wings." As with her previous work, Swick resolutely travels the domestic landscape, detailing delicately and truthfully the effect of Trina's death on the unstable triangle of the family left behind. Each member finds their bonds of love and loyalty tested, and each is resilient in the face of their loss, but for different -- perhaps too different -- reasons: Giselle must get Teddy through the crisis, but Dan, his stepfather, having just lost his daughter, has no such responsibility.\nTold alternately from the point of view of Giselle and Teddy himself, "Evening News" is a beautifully accomplished novel about resilience in the face of loss -- and about the irrevocable damage that both the loss and the resilience can inflict.	1999	Little Brown &amp; Co	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0316825336.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

826308791	The Education of Little Tree (A Zia Book)	Forrest Carter	Cherokee Indians	The Education of Little Tree has been embedded in controversy since the revelation that the autobiographical story told by Forrest Carter was a complete fabrication. The touching novel, which has entranced readers since it was first published in 1976, has since raised questions, many unanswered, about how this quaint and engaging tale of a young, orphaned boy could have been written by a man whose life was so overtly rooted in hatred. How can this story, now discovered to be fictitious, fill our hearts with so much emotion as we champion Little Tree's childhood lessons and future successes?\nThe Education of Little Tree tells with poignant grace the story of a boy who is adopted by his Cherokee grandmother and half-Cherokee grandfather in the Appalachian Mountains of Tennessee during the Great Depression. "Little Tree," as his grandparents call him, is shown how to hunt and survive in the mountains and taught to respect nature in the Cherokee Way--taking only what is needed, leaving the rest for nature to run its course. Little Tree also learns the often callous ways of white businessmen, sharecroppers, Christians, and politicians. Each vignette, whether frightening, funny, heartwarming, or sad, teaches our protagonist about life, love, nature, work, friendship, and family. A classic of its era and an enduring book for all ages, The Education of Little Tree continues to share important lessons. Little Tree's story allows us to reflect on the past and look toward the future. It offers us an opportunity to ask ourselves what we have learned and where it will take us.	1986	University of New Mexico Press	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0826308791.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

441003257	Good Omens	Neil Gaiman	Fiction	There is a hint of Armageddon in the air. According to the Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch (recorded, thankfully, in 1655, before she blew up her entire village and all its inhabitants, who had gathered to watch her burn), the world will end on a Saturday. Next Saturday, in fact. So the Armies of Good and Evil are massing, the four Bikers of the Apocalypse are revving up their mighty hogs and hitting the road, and the world's last two remaining witchfinders are getting ready to Fight the Good Fight. Atlantis is rising. Frogs are falling. Tempers are flaring, and everything appears to be going to Divine Plan.\nExcept that a somewhat fussy angel and a fast-living demon are not particularly looking forward to the coming Rapture. They've lived amongst Humanity for millennia, and have grown rather fond of the lifestyle. So if Crowley and Aziraphale are going to stop it from happening, they've got to find and kill the AntiChrist (which is a shame, really, as he's a nice kid). There's just one glitch: someone seems to have misplaced him.\nTerry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman's brilliantly dark and funny take on mankind's final judgment is back, in a new hardcover edition which includes an introduction by the authors, comments by each about the other, and answers to some still-burning questions about their wildly popular collaborative effort that the devout and the damned alike will surely cherish until the end of all things.	1996	Ace Books	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0441003257.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

Since then, millions of people have visited the church to receive a touch from God.

440500095	Unassigned Territory	Kem Nunn	Fiction	"[An] accomplished new novel that confirms the promise of Nunn's first book, Tapping the Source .... Nunn writes with a keen portentousness about the warped people in this wasteland, creating what might be described as a western gothic. His examination of cultish thought is respectful, intriguing, and funny, in a narrative that never loses dramatic momentum." — Publishers Weekly\nLay preacher Obadiah Wheeler is responsible for conducting a group of missionaries into "unassigned territory," a stretch of Nevada wilderness open to evangelistic efforts. Obadiah's faith is shaky at best and no match for the tempting charms of the co-proprietor of a desert museum, raven-haired beauty Delandra Hummer. Together the two set off into the vast emptiness of the Mojave in search of a buyer for the museum's prize exhibit, an extraterrestrial relic. Their hilarious road trip — punctuated by encounters with UFO cults, wild rednecks, and hippie burnouts — throbs with violence and madness as well as the possibility of spiritual enlightenment. This "desert noir" by National Book Award nominee Kem Nunn was recognized as a New York Times Book Review Editor's Choice; the author has also written for and produced numerous TV projects, among them John from Cincinnati, Deadwood, and Sons of Anarchy.	1988	Bantam Dell Pub Group	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0440500095.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

60930535	The Poisonwood Bible: A Novel	Barbara Kingsolver	Fiction	“Powerful . . . [Kingsolver] has with infinitely steady hands worked the prickly threads of religion, politics, race, sin and redemption into a thing of terrible beauty.” —Los Angeles Times Book Review\nThe Poisonwood Bible, now celebrating its 25th anniversary, established Barbara Kingsolver as one of the most thoughtful and daring of modern writers. Taking its place alongside the classic works of postcolonial literature, it is a suspenseful epic of one family's tragic undoing and remarkable reconstruction over the course of three decades in Africa.\nThe story is told by the wife and four daughters of Nathan Price, a fierce, evangelical Baptist who takes his family and mission to the Belgian Congo in 1959. They carry with them everything they believe they will need from home, but soon find that all of it—from garden seeds to Scripture—is calamitously transformed on African soil.\nThe novel is set against one of the most dramatic political chronicles of the twentieth century: the Congo's fight for independence from Belgium, the murder of its first elected prime minister, the CIA coup to install his replacement, and the insidious progress of a world economic order that robs the fledgling African nation of its autonomy. Against this backdrop, Orleanna Price reconstructs the story of her evangelist husband's part in the Western assault on Africa, a tale indelibly darkened by her own losses and unanswerable questions about her own culpability. Also narrating the story, by turns, are her four daughters—the teenaged Rachel; adolescent twins Leah and Adah; and Ruth May, a prescient five-year-old. These sharply observant girls, who arrive in the Congo with racial preconceptions forged in 1950s Georgia, will be marked in surprisingly different ways by their father's intractable mission, and by Africa itself. Ultimately each must strike her own separate path to salvation. Their passionately intertwined stories become a compelling exploration of moral risk and personal responsibility.	1999	Perennial	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0060930535.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

At thirty-five. On her own. But Anne Lamott makes it all fresh in her now-classic account of how she and her son and numerous friends and neighbors and some strangers survived and thrived in that all important first year.

486203077	Tales of Terror and the Supernatural	Wilkie Collins	Fiction	Wilkie Collins (1824-89), associate of Charles Dickens and author of 15 novels, is perhaps best known for the great mystery novel The Moonstone. But Collins also wrote short stories, tales of terror and the supernatural, which many consider comparable to those of Poe and J. Sheridan LeFanu.\nThis collection features 12 of Collins’ most masterful horror tales: "The Dream Woman," "A Terribly Strange Bed," "The Dead Hand," "The Biter Bit," "Fauntleroy," "Blow Up with the Brig!," "A Stolen Letter," "The Lady of Glenwith Grange," "Mr. Policeman and the Cook," "Mr. Lepel and the Housekeeper," "Miss Bertha and the Yankee," and "Mad Monkton." Herbert van Thal, the noted authority of Victorian literature, has made the selection, and has also contributed a new introduction summarizing Collins' life and briefly evaluating his career.\nThese tales are not easily forgotten; they feature unusually imaginative situations, coupled with vivid descriptions and surprising plots. Collins' ventures into the shadowy realms of the half-dead and his explorations of subtle, morbid psychology, strange diseases, and uncanny coincidences are every bit as fascinating and terrifying as those of Poe. Also like Poe, he was an excellent craftsman, able to carry the suspense to the very end by keeping the mystery shrouded until the final page.\nAlthough a few of these stories have been anthologized, most of them are now extremely hard to find. With this reprinting, they will once again be available both to lovers of supernatural fiction and to those who enjoy perfection in the art of storytelling. As G. K. Chesterton put it: "Wilkie Collins is the one man of unmistakable genius who has an affinity with Dickens … there were no two men who could touch them at a ghost story."	1972	Dover Publications	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0486203077.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

And in New York in the 1990s, Clarissa Vaughan steps out of her smart Greenwich Village apartment and goes shopping for flowers for the party she is giving in honour of her life-long friend Richard, an award-winning poet whose mind and body are being ravaged by AIDS. These are the characters in Michael Cunningham's exquisite and deeply moving novel, which takes Woolf's life and work as inspiration for a meditation on artistic behaviour, failure, love and madness. Moving effortlessy across the decades and between England and America, Cunningham's elegant, haunting prose explores the pain and trauma of creativity and the immutable relationship between writer and reader.	2000	Picador	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0312243022.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg

465016103	The Other Path: The Economic Answer to Terrorism	Hernando De Soto	Business & Economics	In this, his classic book on the informal economy of Peru and the reasons why poverty can be a breeding ground for terrorists, Hernando De Soto describes the forces that keep people dependent on underground economies: the bureaucratic barriers to legal property ownership and the lack of legal structures that recognize and encourage ownership of assets. It is exactly these forces, de Soto argues, that prevent houses, land, and machines from functioning as capital does in the West -- as assets that can be leveraged to create more capital. Under the Fujimori government, de Soto's Institute for Liberty and Democracy wrote dozens of laws to promote property rights and bring people out of the informal economy and into the legitimate one. The result was not only an economic boon for Peru but also the defeat of the Shining Path, the terrorist movement and black-market force that was then threatening to take over the Peruvian government. In a new preface, de Soto relates his work to the present moment, making the connection between the Shining Path in the 1980's and the Taliban today.	2002	Perseus Books Group	http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0465016103.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg
